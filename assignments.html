              <strong>Javascript != Java</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Javascript is a programming language developed in the late 1990s by Netscape. Microsoft said no.
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              It's similar to most other programming languages, variables, loops, logic, functions. The difference is the browser engine.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Modern browsers let you practice javascript inside the browser in real time. How is this different from a language like C++? <br/>Javascript is still compiled, but it is compiled in the browser by the browser's javascript engine.
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              This means we can test our javascript in the browser before saving it to our .js files!
            </p>

              <strong>Numbers</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              We can use the javascript console in Google Chrome to write some JS! Open up Google Chrome.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>Right click anywhere on the page and click 'inspect element'. Then click the console tab. (insert explanation of devtools here)</li>
                <li>There are a handful of variable types in javascript (insert explanation of variables here). Let's start with numbers. Type some numbers in your JS console.</li>
                <li>We can also do math in our console! Let's try some basic math. Add 2 numbers together. <pre>2 + 7</pre></li>
                <li>We can get into the negatives as well. Create a negative math equation <pre>2 * 7 - 100</pre></li>
                <li>Decimals also work (kinda). Do some arithmetic with decimals. <pre>.5 * .5</pre><pre>.83 + .17</pre><pre>.999 - 3.212</pre></li>
                <li>What about decimal subtraction? <pre>2 - .3</pre><pre>.86 - .177</pre><pre>.3 - .2</pre></li> What happened on that last one?<br>Like in other programming languages, decimals are floating point numbers, meaning the arithmetic can get sticky. Don't always trust your math to be correct! Always check it!

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Strings are a little bit funner to play with than numbers.

                <li>Guess, what? Strings can be added together too! Create two different strings and add them together. <pre>"My name is " + "Josh Soileau"</pre></li>
                <li>But we get into weird stuff when we add two different TYPES of things together. Add a number and a string together. <pre>"My Name Is " + 42</pre><pre>2 + "2"</pre><pre>"86" + 7 + 5 + "3" + 0 + "9"</pre>How does this work? (insert explanation of auto-type conversion)</li>

              We now know we can create numbers and strings. But we will need to be able to save those things in memory. Enter the 'var' javascript keyword.

                <li>Variables work for all data types.

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              So we can create these variables, but that's useless unless we add a little logic into it. Let's start with 'if', 'else' statements.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>

                     Here's an example: <pre class="visible">var oldLadyIsSinging = 1;<br/><br/>if( oldLadyIsSinging ) {<br/>    var itIsOver = 1;<br/>}</pre></li>
                <li>What if we only want something to happen if the 'if' condition fails? 'Else' statements! <pre class="visible">var oldLadyIsSinging = 1;<br/><br/>if( oldLadyIsSinging ) {<br/>    var itIsOver = 1;<br/>} else {<br/>    var itIsOver = 0;<br/>}</pre></li>
                <li>We've secretly just introduced a NEW data type, BOOLEANS! Booleans are a data type that can only ever have 1 of 2 different values, true or false. Booleans are used in 'if' statements and loops. Here's a few examples of Booleans: <pre class="visible">true</pre><pre class="visible">false</pre>In addition to those two, comparison expressions can be evaluated as a boolean. Try putting these in your console and see what you get: <pre>10 > 5</pre><pre>10 > 15</pre><pre>var myNameString = "My name is Josh Soileau";<br/>myNameString === "My name is Josh Soileau"</pre><pre>var myNameString = 123456;<br/>myNameString === "My name is Josh Soileau"</pre>(insert explanation of === vs == )</li>
                <li>All of these examples of booleans can be used inside an if statement as the condition to check!</li>

              <strong>Arrays</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Let's learn about yet another data type in javascript: arrays. Arrays are one of the most useful things in javascript, they let you organize things in groups.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>Arrays are defined by square brackets []. When the compiler sees those square brackets, it knows to expect an array of items inside the brackets. <pre class="visible">[ ARRAY ITEMS GO IN HERE ]</pre></li>
                <li>The items inside the brackets are all separated by commas, to signify the dividers to the compiler. <pre class="visible">[ arrayItem, anotherArrayItem, yetAnotherArrayItem ]</pre>In the above case we have an array of size 3.</li>
                <li>Create an array of strings. Make it have at least 4 items in it, and make each item be your favorite topping on a pizza. Save that array to a variable. <pre>var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];</pre></li>
                <li>Okay, so we now have an array with values in it. How do we get those values later? We can access arrays using INDEXES</li>
                <li>What are indexes? They are slots in the array! But the secret is that the first slot of the array is index "0" (like all things comp sci) (insert explanation of starting at 0 and not 1). <br>Think of it this way:<pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ]<br/><br/>   Index 0    Index 1        Index 2         Index 3        Index 4</pre></li>
                <li>So the way we access indexes of the array are by using indexes in the array. Here's the syntax: <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/>pizzaToppings[ NUMBER OF INDEX I WANT TO ACCESS ]</pre></li>  
                <li>To get the first index of the array we would use the 0th index. <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[0];</pre></li>
                <li>To get the third index of the array we would use the 2nd index. <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[2];</pre></li>
                <li>How do we get the last item in the array? In this case we know it's the 4th index. <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[4];</pre>But what if we didn't know how long our array was? What if somebody inserts a 6th item in the array without us knowing?<br/>You can learn how long an array is by calling ".length" on it like this; <pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ].length</pre>Which is the same thing as saying: <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/>pizzaToppings.length</pre>Notice how it returns the number "5". But our last index is index #4! So to get the last element in the array, we could do this: <pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/><br/>pizzaToppings[ pizzaToppings.length - 1 ];</pre></li>
                <li>It's important to note that arrays don't have to hold just 1 type of data. You can have an array of anything! <pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", 42, 999 ]<br>[ "Rocky", true, false, "Bullwinkle" ]</pre>You can even have an array of arrays! <pre class="visible">[ [12, 32], ["Cherry", "Vanilla", false] ]</pre></li>
              </ul>

              <strong>Logic pt. 2: For Loops!</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Sometimes you want to run the same bit of code over and over again. There are a couple of ways to do that in javascript, we are going to start with For loops!
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
              <li>For loops are similar to if statements. You have some parenthesis and some curly braces. The code inside the curly braces is the code that runs during the loop. Here's the syntax: <pre class="visible">for( BEFORE CODE ; WHILE CONDITION ; AFTER CODE ) {<br/>    CODE TO BE RUN DURING LOOP <br/>}<br/><br/>BEFORE CODE: this is set at the beginning of the loop<br>It is usually something like var i=0 or something like that<br/><br/>WHILE CONDITION: the condition to keep running the loop<br/><br/>AFTER CODE: this runs after every iteration of the loop</pre></li>
              <li>Here's a simple example of for loops: <pre class="visible">var i;<br>var concatNumbersVar = "";<br>for( i=0; i<6; i++) {<br>    concatNumbersVar = concatNumbersVar + i;<br>}</pre>At the top, we create two variables, one isn't defined yet (i), the other is an empty string. The loop starts at i = 0, and loops through as long as i < 6, but increasing i by 1 every time the loop finishes.<br>The code inside the loop takes our empty string, and appends a number on the back of it every time the loop happens (remember what happens when you add a string and a number together?)</li>
              <li>Exercise time!
                <ul>
                  <li>Think about all the mechanical parts of an airplane. Create an array (at least length 6) containing all the parts of a plane that you think it needs to fly, and save that array to a variable.</li>
                  <li>Using a For loop iterate through this array, and use the "alert()" function to pop up and say each part of the plane.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Extended Exercise.
              <ul>
                <li>Instead of creating an array and then iterating through it like we just did, we are going to build our array in a for loop. Create an empty array called "airplaneParts"</li>

              <strong>All about functions!</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Sometimes in programming we have to repeat ourselves multiple times. When it comes to that kind of thing, we have a rule in programming. It's called D.R.Y., DON'T REPEAT YOURSELVES. Luckily, in programming, we have a concept called functions that let us perform repetetive behaviors in a simple way.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
              <li>Let's take a common use case. We want print out to a greeting to the user.
                  If you did that without a function you would do something like this:
<pre class="visible">var userName = "Josh Soileau";
console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
console.log('It's nice to see you today.');
console.log('Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.')
console.log('Better get to work!');</pre>
              </li>
              <li>But if you had different userNames, you'd have to do all 5 lines over and over again for every user.
                  Or, we could just use a function!
                  Here's the function syntax:
                  <pre class="visible">
var myFunctionName = function( PARAMETER TO GIVE THE FUNCTION ) {
  CODE INSIDE THE FUNCTION
};
                  </pre>
                  So then, whenever you wanted to run "CODE INSIDE THE FUNCTION", you would just call the function like this:
                  <pre class="visible">
myFunctionName( SOME PARAMETER I WANT TO PASS );
                  </pre>
                  I know that can be confusing, let's see an example.<br>Here's the code we had before, but this time in function form!
                  <pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
  console.log('It's nice to see you today.');
  console.log('Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.')
  console.log('Better get to work!');
};
                  </pre>
                  IMPORTANT NOTE: Just writing that code out WILL NOT RUN that code. <br>
                  All we did in that code was tell the computer "If anyone ever calls the function 'greetTheUser', do this code right here".<br>
                  To actuall run the code, we have to "call" it, like this:
                  <pre class="visible">
greetTheUser( "Josh Soileau" );
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  So what is the thing inside of our call to greetTheUser()?<br>That is our "parameter".<br>
                  Functions work a bit like machines, you give them SOMETHING, and they do things with it!<br>
                  In this case, we are "giving" our greetTheUser function a string called "Josh Soileau".<br>
                  Let's look at our function again:
                  <pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
  console.log('It's nice to see you today.');
  console.log('Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.')
  console.log('Better get to work!');
};
                  </pre>
                  As you see, our function expects to be passed something (as you can see because there is a variable inside the parenthesis of the function declaration).<br>
                  We are saying that the greetTheUser function expects to be called and passed an argument, and we are going to call that argument 'userName'.<br>
                  The function doesn't know WHAT it is being passed, just that it is being passed SOMETHING.<br>
                  Exercise: Try calling the function with a different data type, like a number, array, or object.
                  <pre>
greetTheUser( 12.34 );
greetTheUser( "HAL" );
                  </pre>
                  As you can see, it treats it the same way! It saves whatever it is being passed into this 'userName' variable, and tries to use it as well as it can.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Functions can also return values that we can save for later. See this example:
                  <pre class="visible">
var timesTwo = function(number) {
    return number * 2;
};

var thisShouldEqualFourteen = timesTwo( 7 );
                  </pre>
                  The above function expects to receive a number, does some math, and gives back a new number.<br>
                  We can save the result in a variable. Super useful!
                </li>

              </ul>
            </p>

            </p>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Lets take a look at a concept called "scoping".
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Here's our previous function:
                  <pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
  console.log('It's nice to see you today.');
  console.log('Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.')
  console.log('Better get to work!');
};
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>Inside this function we make a variable called "userName". What happens if we try and access that variable somewhere else, like this:
                  <pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
  console.log('It's nice to see you today.');
  console.log('Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.')
  console.log('Better get to work!');
};

console.log( userName );
                  </pre>
                  What do we get there and why?<br>
                  In javascript, variables (and functions) are only available in the context they are defined in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Think of scoping like each bit of code is a small piece of a neighborhood.<br>
                  Each "function" is a fenced in property. Anything on the inside, stays in the inside.<br>
                  In our example above, the "userName" variable is created inside our fenced in yard.<br>
                  But then we try and use that variable OUTSIDE of the fence, and it doesn't work. That is because OUTSIDE of the fence, we don't know what "userName" is, it is undefined!
                </li>
                <li>
                  The same thing will happen here as well:
                  <pre class="visible">
var prepareForUser = function( userName ) {
  var greetingString = "Hello, " + userName;
  var userAge = 54;
  var userFavoriteColor = "Beige";
};

// ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CALL YOUR FUNCTION!
// Otherwise, the code inside it won't run! 
prepareForUser( "Josh Soileau" );

console.log( greetingString );
console.log( "Your age is " + userAge );
console.log( "Your favorite color is " + userFavoriteColor );
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  So how do we fix that code above??<br> 
                  Remember how our code is kind of like a neighborhood with fences in it?<br>
                  Well, if we create a variable OUTSIDE of ALL of the fences, then that variable is available everywhere, even INSIDE the fences.<br>
                  That is called a variable being "global". Let's look at an example:
                  <pre class="visible">
var wildNeighborhoodDog = "Fido";
var dogIsFarAway = 1;

var callDog = function( dogName ) {

  if( dogIsFarAway ) {
    console.log( "Here, " + dogName + ", here boy!" );
  } else {
    console.log( "Good boy, " + dogName );
  }

};

callDog( wildNeighborhoodDog );
                  </pre>
                  Because our "wildNeighborhoodDog" and "dogIsFarAway" variables are GLOBAL, we can use them inside our "callDog" function.<br><br>
                  Let's try and fix our code from before. We can solve our problem by making the variables global, like this:
                  <pre class="visible">
var greetingString;
var userAge;
var userFavoriteColor;

var prepareForUser = function( userName ) {
  greetingString = "Hello, " + userName;
  userAge = 54;
  userFavoriteColor = "Beige";
};

// ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CALL YOUR FUNCTION!
// Otherwise, the code inside it won't run! 
prepareForUser( "Josh Soileau" );

console.log( greetingString );
console.log( "Your age is " + userAge );
console.log( "Your favorite color is " + userFavoriteColor );
                  </pre>
                  All we had to do is DECLARE our variables globally. We didn't even need to assign them any value. <br>Just the act of declaring them outside the function meant that we could access them outside the function later on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now we know that we can make variables GLOBAL and have access to them everywhere. So why don't we do this for everything??<br>
                  Take a look at this code below, tell me what the output is:
                  <pre class="visible">
var numberOfBalloons = 99;
var balloonsColor = "Red";

var popOneBalloon = function( balloonsColor ) {

  numberOfBalloons = numberOfBalloons - 1;
  var balloonsColor = "Blue";

};

console.log( numberOfBalloons + " " +  balloonsColor + " balloons go by." );
                  </pre>
                  What is the output of that code and why? (move the console.log around to learn more)
                </li>
                <li>
                  This type of thing is why it's a bad idea to have too many global variables. By saying that YOUR variable is global, you are effectively preventing other coders from using that variable name in different scopes. If you can, try and do without global variables.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

greetTheUser( myName );</pre>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Now it's time for today's big assignment.<br>
              We are going to build a banking system in our browser.<br>
              For organizational purposes, this would be better kept inside of a ".js" file.<br>
              So, open up a text editor (like sublime text) and create a new file on the desktop called banking.js<br><br>
              We are going to be creating a series of functions to handle a series of global variables.<br><br>
              These exercises will intentionally be left unanswered for now, and will be filled in during class as we complete them.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  First, create global variables for userName, userAddress, accountNumber, accountOpenDate, and accountBalance.<br>
                  For now, these variables will be strings and numbers. We may change that later on to account for multiple account holders if we have time.<br>
                  Declare your variables at the TOP of your file.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  First thing's first. Create a function called printAccountInfo that will print the information for this user's account using console.log.<br>
                  It may be helpful, as well, to create a printBalance function that will ONLY print the balance and not the rest of the info.
                </li>
                <li>After we have the our printAccountInfo function, we need functions to manage our balance.<br>
                    First, we will need a setBalance function, which will do exactly that, set the accountBalance variable to some number that is passed as a parameter to the setBalance function.</li>
                <li>
                  Next we will need withdraw() and deposit() functions, which will accept a parameter, and use the setBalance function to either add or remove that parameter from the accountBalance function.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Our customers may also want to change their address. Let's create a setAddress function that will accept a string as a parameter, and set the address variable to that string.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let's say we are the most kick ass bank in the world, and we are giving awesome interest rates on savings accounts.<br>
                  Let's say we give a 3% interest rate, and we give it EVERY SINGLE DAY.<br>
                  Make a new function called giveInterest which will increase the balance by 3%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One of the selling points of our bank is this awesome interest rate. Sometimes we get requests from our customers to tell them what their balance will be after 10 years in the future, at 3% interest, accrued daily.<br><br>
                  Write a function called predictBalance that will accept 1 parameter, the # of years the want to predict, and will return the balance in the account after that amount of time.<br><br>
                  Important note: this function DOES NOT CHANGE the balance, it just predicts what the balance will be after X number of years at 3% interest.<br><br>
                  Another important note: this can be accomplished a few different ways (like everything in programming). It can be done with for loops, while loops, you can even do it with recursive functions if you want to get elegant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If time is left over at this point, change our variable types to ARRAYS, and modify all the functions to be able to handle multiple account holders.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              This is where you get your feet wet with objects. Objects are everywhere in JS. They are an additional datatype, like Number and Array. In fact, they are quite similar to arrays in that they are multiple, multidimensional data stores and can contain any type of data. You can have an objet of objects, and object of arrays, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              The fundamental difference between objects and arrays is their construction as key/value pairs. Where arrays are simple collections with a numerical key, objects take a specified keyword. Objects can be referenced either by square bracket notation or by dot syntax. More about that below.
            </p>
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              We won't get too deep into objects in this class, just enough to get started working with the DOM. But understanding how to use objets is key to understanding more advanced JavaScript and learning how to use JS frameworks like jQuery, Angular, Node, Backbone, Underscore, Moment, Meteor, React... The list goes on (and on).

                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Basic Notation</span>. Objects are defined using curly braces. Inside the curly braces, your object will contain one or many key/value pairs, separated by a comma. Each key and value is separated by a colon. The key may be written without quotes, with single-quotes or with double-quotes.

                  <span class="text-highlight">Accessing Values</span>. To access the value of an object, simply refer to its key either via dot notation or by accessing its key in square brackets.
                  <pre class="visible">
var dog = {
  breed: 'Great Dane',
  color: 'harlequin',
  food: 'small children'
};

// get the value using dot notation
dog.food;

// get the value using bracket notation
dog['food'];

// ^^^ note that we used food as a string in the last line.

                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Properties and Methods</span>. In regular JS, we have variables and functions. In objects, we generally refer to properties and methods in the same way. While this isn't as strict as other programming languages, you're still going to run into the terminology. Properties describe the object. Methods do something.
                  <pre class="visible">
var dog = {
  // properties

  breed: 'Great Dane',
  color: 'harlequin',
  food: 'small children',
  
  // methods

  bark: function() {
    alert('WOOF!');
  },
  
  getColor: function() {
    return this.color;
    // this refers to the context in which the funciton is called
    // this can get you into trouble
    // if you're really curious, look up JavaScript's call() funciton
  }
};

dog.bark();

dog.getColor();
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Native Objects</span>. JavaScript comes packages with a number of native objects like Math and Date. Back in the day, many designers worked with the Image object to preload mouseover images before you could really do that with CSS. Native objects ship with the browser (hence native) and are always there.
                  <pre class="visible">
var someDate = new Date();
someDate.getFullYear(); // ZOMG!

// the Math object is really quite useful
console.log('The Life of ' + Math.PI);

// no, really
Math.round(Math.PI);

// by the way, this stuff is case sensitive, so watch out!
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">The document and window Objects</span>. Here is where things get a little more fun, especially for those of you who are bored of working exclusively in the console. Go ahead and type the following into the browser console:
                  <pre class="visible">
window.
                  </pre>
                  Notice the console is trying to autocomplete for you. Each autocomplete possibility is a member of the window object. With so many API's within the HTML spec, you have access to a TON of possibilities. Play with window.history and see what's in there.<br>
                  <br><!-- ugh, I know -->
                  The same goes for the document object. We have access to all kinds of browser behaviors just through the native document object. This is how we'll manipulate the DOM later on in the class.  For now, let's move on ... what is the DOM, anyway?<br>&nbsp; <!-- gah! -->
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          </div>

            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <strong>The Document Object Model</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              When you write an HTML document and load it in a browser, the browser interprets your HTML and builds a web page. The elements you write, the attributes in your elements and the text inside your elements are all nested together neatly in your HTML. The browser translates this structure into the page as a hierarchy of nodes and relationships. This is the DOM. It is simply a representation of the constructed web page itself, mapped to a hierarchical tree. Think of it as a map. The HTML you write is parsed by the browser and becomes the DOM. The DOM is the foundation of the page you see.
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">A Simple Page</span>. Consider the following HTML.
                  <pre class="visible">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The World Cup is over&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1 class="header"&gt;The World Cup is, like, over&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p style="color: #933;"&gt;Now we have to watch baseball. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="footnote"&gt;Just kidding! Baseball is totes exciting cuz they score lots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                  </pre>
                  Once the browser reads the markup and constructs the page, the DOM will look something like this.
                  <pre class="visible">
html
  |-head
  | |-title
  | | |-"The World Cup is over"
  | |-link
  | | |-(rel="icon")
  | | |-(type="image/x-icon")
  | | |-(href="/images/favicon.ico")
  |-body
    |-div
    |-(class="container")
    |-h1
    | |-(class="header")
    | |-"The World Cup is, like, over"
    |-p
    | |-(style="color: #933;")
    | |-"Now we have to watch baseball. Ugh."
    |-p
      |-(class="footnote")
      |-"Just kidding! Baseball is totes exciting cuz they score lots."
                  </pre>
                  That is the DOM. You have element nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes. Technically, you could also have comment nodes, but let's stick with these three for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">In the console</span>. Open up a console window. When you look at you document structure (Elements tab in Chrome Inspector, HTML tab in Firefox), it looks like the HTML you would have written. But this series of collapsible HTML is a visual representation of the DOM.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  This is the interpreted DOM. As we'll see in the next section, we can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. The result of those manipulations will be different than the original HTML document. But the browser console will always reflect the current state of the DOM.<br>&nbsp;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <strong>The DOM API</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              Okay, great. We have the DOM. So what? The browser downloads your HTML, styles are applied, images and fonts loaded. Without a line of JavaScript, the DOM exists and a polished web page gets painted to my browser. What good is JavaScript?
            </p>
            
            <p class="assignment_box_details">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">getElementById()</span>. Change is good. The DOM API (an API is just a way for one program (e.g. ours) to talk to another (e.g. the browser)) lets us manipulate the page. Let's say we wanted to change the h1 element on a page. Before we can change the element, we have to select it. The easiest way is to select a node by its ID, since <span class="text-highlight">an ID can only appear once on a page</span>.
                  <br>&nbsp;<br>
                  Open this codepen: <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/mccambridge/pen/fHKmn">http://codepen.io/mccambridge/pen/fHKmn</a>. In the JavaScript window on the right, enter the following code. The result will automatically re-run.
                  <pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.getElementById('the-title');
alert(theHeader);
                  </pre>
                  getElementById() is a method on the document object. Notice the contents of the alert? It's an object. Every DOM element is an object. We'll learn what to do with that in a minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Accessing a Text Node</span> Now that we have access to an element and remembering that text is a node in itself, how can we dive one level down into the text node?
                  <pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.getElementById('the-title');
alert(theHeader.innerHTML);
                  </pre>
                  innerHTML is a property of our HTML node object. It is simply a record of the HTML inside of this node. In the current case, the only HTML left is simple text.  Let's try changing it.
                  <pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.getElementById('the-title');
theHeader.innerHTML = 'Well, why don\'t you write your own header.';
                  </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Other Ways To Access a Node</span> The browser gives us a few other methods to grab hold of our HTML elements. Let's start with document.getElementsByTagName(). Notice it's 'elements' (plural). This method returns an array. Try the following in the CodePen.
                  <pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.getElementsByTagName('h1');
alert(theHeader.length);
                  </pre>
                  What happens if you add another h1 element? What if you want to manipulate the h1 elements? How would you accomplish that (remember looping around arrays from previous classes)?
                  <br>&nbsp;<br>
                  The API also provides document.getElementsByClassName() which also returns an array but takes &mdash; you guessed it! &mdash; a class name as its parameter.
                  <br>&nbsp;<br>
                  More recently, browser developers have included the document.querySelector() method, which takes a CSS selector, just like jQuery. Try this one in the CodePen:
                  <pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.querySelector('#the-title');
theHeader.innerHTML = 'This works with id, class and tag name. It selects the first instance of a match.'
                  </pre>
                  The API also provides document.querySelectorAll() which returns multiples. MDN does a good job documenting the API <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.querySelectorAll">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="text-highlight">Getting And Setting Attributes</span> Aside from text, attributes are the other important side of HTML elements. Text populates our pages with content. Attributes give our elements options. Without attributes, img tags would be sourceless. Anchor tags would be href-less. What if we want to dive into selectors? Let's start with a fresh CodePen: <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/mccambridge/pen/IxGDq">http://codepen.io/mccambridge/pen/IxGDq</a>.
                  <pre class="visible">
var theKitteh = document.querySelector('#awsum-kitteh-pic');
alert(theKitteh.getAttribute('src'));
                  </pre>
                  Using the node's getAttribute() method, we can check to see what the img src attribute is set to. What if we want to change it up?
                  <pre class="visible">
var theKitteh = document.querySelector('#awsum-kitteh-pic');
theKitteh.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/900/200');
                  </pre>
                  setAttribute() takes two parameters. The first selects which parameter on the element is getting reset. The second tells the browser what to set it to. Now, you can change any attribute on any element. Meow!
                </li>
              </ul>
